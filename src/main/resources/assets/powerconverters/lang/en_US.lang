item.pcdebugitem.documentation=This item will tell you the current percent energy stored in a EnergyBridge multi block, simply right click on any Consumer or Producer or the Energy Bridge. It will also show you advanced information about the status of a Energy Conduit Network.
powerconverters.common.bridge.documentation=This is the Common Block for PowerConverters, When you place a consumer next to this block the Consumer will deposit the energy received into the energy bridge, When a Producer is placed next to this block it will produce energy from the energy stored in the Bridge.
powerconverters.common.charger.documentation=In the future this block will charge items placed in it, as well as when you stand on it items in your inventory will be charged.
powerconverters.steam.consumer.documentation=This block when placed next to a EnergyBridge will accept Steam and convert it into energy that will be stored in the EnergyBridge.
powerconverters.steam.producer.documentation=This block when placed next to a EnergyBridge will Provide Steam to adjacent blocks and pipes using the energy stored in the EnergyBridge.
powerconverters.rf.consumer.documentation=This block when placed next to a EnergyBridge will accept Redstone Flux Energy (RF) at a infinite rate and convert it into energy that will be stored in the EnergyBridge.
powerconverters.rf.producer.documentation=This block when placed next to a EnergyBridge will Provide Redstone Flux Energy (RF) at a infinate rate to adjacent blocks and conduits that support RF using the energy stored in the EnergyBridge.
powerconverters.fz.consumer.documentation=This block when placed next to a EnergyBridge will accept Factorization GC and convert it into energy that will be stored in the EnergyBridge.
powerconverters.fz.producer.documentation=This block when placed next to a EnergyBridge will Provice Factorization GC to adjacent blocks and Lead Cables using the energy stored in the EnergyBridge.
powerconverters.ic2.lv.consumer.documentation=This block when placed next to a EnergyBridge will accept EU at a MAX of 32 EU/t (BatBox) and convert it into energy that will be stored in the EnergyBridge.
powerconverters.ic2.lv.producer.documentation=This block when placed next to a EnergyBridge will provide EU at a MAX of 32 EU/t (BatBox) to adjacent blocks and cables using the energy stored in the EnergyBridge.
powerconverters.ic2.mv.consumer.documentation=This block when placed next to a EnergyBridge will accept EU at a MAX of 128 EU/t (CESU) and convert it into energy that will be stored in the EnergyBridge.
powerconverters.ic2.mv.producer.documentation=This block when placed next to a EnergyBridge will provide EU at a MAX of 128 EU/t (CESU) to adjacent blocks and cables using the energy stored in the EnergyBridge.
